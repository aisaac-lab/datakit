# datakit
  Currently datakit is a assemble of methods to preprocess open data. A preprocessing open data is a something all we do. Even if we share same aim, source codes are not shared so much. Itâ€™s nice idea to refrain it as open source project.

We appreciate these values: 
- Latest data
- Cleaned data (unixtime, UTF-8, without duplicate..)
- Support major formats(csv, json, xml, hdf)
- Community based

# Try it on your local
    $ mkdir data
    $ docker-compose run importer bash -l -c "python jp/python/bank/all.py"
    $ cat data/output.csv

# feature works
- provide framework for preprocessing data.
- allow user to select which and how data column will be composed.
